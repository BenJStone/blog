Thanks Google. What a cool personalised Google birthday doodle.

After visiting Google&#8217;s homepage on my birthday I got a pleasant surprise. Google now celebrates your birthday with a doodle.  
To get a personalise Google Doodle on your birthday you have to be signed in and obviously it has to be your birthday.
